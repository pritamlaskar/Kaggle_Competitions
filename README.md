# Kaggle_Competitions
Kaggle is one of the perfect platforms to learn and evaluate our data analysis skills. Here are some of the competitions in which I have taken part:</br> </br>
• ***Kaggle_Titanic-Spaceship***: A spin-off of the original Titanic competition, this spaceship Titanic is set in the year 2912 where it met a similar fate to that of the Titanic 1000 years ago. I have used Random Forest Classifier to predict the number of survivors. Link to competition and dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic. </br> </br>
• ***Kaggle_Walmart-Sales***: Prediction of Walmart store sales using Linear, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regression. Link to competition and dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting.</br></br>
